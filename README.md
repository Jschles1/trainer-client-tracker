For each appointment you complete with this client after the first one, you will be asked how much weight they gained or lost since the last appointment (based on whether their goal was to lose or gain weight). You can view how much progress a client has made toward their goal on their show page.

When you click on "My Clients", your client that has made the most progress towards their goal will be displayed next to "Client With Most Progress Made:". Your client that has showed up for the most appointments will be displayed next to "Client With Most Dedication:"
